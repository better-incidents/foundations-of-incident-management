### Phases and milestones

Most incidents progress through a predictable series of phases and milestones. Milestones are used to describe the active stage of an incident throughout its progression and to define key moments during a retrospective. They are the bedrock that allows an incident manager to frame communication with responders and stakeholders.

#### Declare

* **Impact started**: When the affected system began having problems
* **Detected**: When a monitoring system or human noticed that a system was having problems
* **Acknowledged**: When the person responsible for responding to incidents within the affected system acknowledged the monitoring system's alert
* **Declared**: When the incident management process was started
#### Respond (Investigate, Coordinate, and Communicate)

* **Investigating**: When the first concrete step toward identifying a fix or resolving the problems with the affected system occurred
* **Identified**: When the issue is understood and work is started to mitigate the issue
* **Mitigated**: When the system is no longer exhibiting customer impacting issues and the solution introduced is not durable. Additional engineering work is required to resolve the issue
#### Resolve

* **Resolved**: When the issue is no longer impacting customers and the solution is durable
* **Retrospective preparation**: When preparing and gathering additional data about the incident
* **Retrospective completed**: Retrospective document is complete, any additional follow on retrospectives or other meetings are done and any follow on items have been identified
