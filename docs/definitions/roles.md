### Service ownership

Each product or functionality has clearly defined owners that take responsibility for their services through the entirety of the software lifecycle. Ownership is documented and includes contact information for each product or functionality owner and vendors in the critical dependency path.
### Incident personas

* Incident responder
    * A service owner who is on call and paged for interruptions to a service. They are typically a subject matter expert on the services, or domains such as cloud architecture, database, or operations.
* Incident manager
    * The director and coordinator of overall response who is responsible for tracking work, communicating updates to internal and external stakeholders, and calibrating the team toward mitigation by providing direction and prioritization. This role can be filled by  anyone with sufficient context and ability to perform the stated tasks.
* Stakeholders
    * A broad group of roles whose expectations of the incident response process require management. Throughout the incident, they receive information about the status of current incidents and updates on expectations set by the incident response process.
### Incident response team

The team responsible for mitigating — and ultimately resolving — an incident with a durable solution. This includes all responders and could include customer support if interactions are bi-directional.
