### Severities

Incident severity quickly explains the ballpark impact of an incident. Here is a list of severities and their general impact summary.



* **SEV1**: No customer can use most or all of a product or service. Most pages in our product are not loading or displaying an error message. Data corruption or loss has occurred or will occur. Loss of revenue is happening or imminent.
* **SEV2**: Primary product functionality is severely impacted and unusable. Customers are unable to utilize a common feature to its fullest ability. Data may not be displayed as expected but not lost. There is no workaround for customers.
* **SEV3**: Some customers (not all) are receiving intermittent errors on product pages or cannot use the product in possibly obscure ways. The product may be loading slowly or partially (missing images), and there is a workaround that customers can use.
