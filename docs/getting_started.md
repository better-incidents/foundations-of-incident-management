# Before you start

The incident response process in this repository is simply a starting place you can use to inform and craft your own program. That said, there are a few things you’ll need to have in place before you get started.

* A `#new-incidents` chat channel in your company’s chat tool where incident managers will broadcast newly declared incidents and status updates throughout the incident.
* Incident email distribution list (example: [new-incidents-grp@example.com](mailto:new-incidents-grp@example.com)) to broadcast newly declared incidents and status updates throughout the incident.
* Defined severity levels based on your organization’s specific business needs.
* A service ownership database or software that documents the owners of services and functionalities.
* An on-call rotation and paging solution that enables bringing service owners into incidents quickly, with an engineering leader in the escalation path.
