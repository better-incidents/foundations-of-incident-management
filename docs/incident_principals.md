## Incident response principles

Incidents have a large blast radius. For our purposes, we'll focus on the audiences that are most directly affected.

* Incident responders: The people directly responsible for resolving incidents
* Customers: The people who feel the most immediate pain from incidents; these could be internal users of a software service or external customers of a product
* Organization: The people who experience cascading or long-term repercussions from incidents; these are often colleagues in support, legal, marketing, and sales

For each of these personas, we follow the following principles during an incident:
### As a responder:

* I avoid troubleshooting on the customer's dime and prioritize remediation, even if that creates additional engineering work later.
* I escalate to another individual or team when it is clear an incident needs additional support.
* I clearly communicate with the other people responding to the incident and avoid being a silent hero.
### As an affected customer:

* I receive proactive communication about incidents.
* I know what functionality is impacted and how.
* I know when to expect updates or, if possible, remediation.
* I know about any potential workarounds.
### As an organization:

* We give the necessary space to the team(s) responding and resolving the incident.
* We give time for an effective response by rescheduling meetings and modifying deadlines.
* We receive incident-related communication at the appropriate time in the agreed upon way.
