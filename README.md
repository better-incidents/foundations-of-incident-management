# Foundations of Incident Management

Better Incidents is where incident management practitioners come to learn, connect, and share. Get the resources and best practices to better manage — and learn from — incidents. This repository contains all of the open source process documents and templates. Please feel free to read, contribute, and fork everything you find.

## How to use this repository

This repository contains necessary documentation to jumpstart an incident management program with your team. From definitions, process, to template, we're trying to provide what we're calling **Sane Defaults** to everyone hoping to level up their incident management. We've built this guide based on our own experiences at FireHydrant, input from our frinds in the community, and maybe someday, you!

All documentation can be found in the `docs/` folder, with additional subfolders for definitions and resources like the incident managers template.

### Incident Process

The Incident Process document is helpful to align teams on a single process as you begin to start your incident management program for engineering. It covers:

* Declaration - How we declare incidents.
* Response - How we investigate, coordinate, and communicate.
* Mitigation - What we consider mitigation, and what we do when we've mitigated.
* Durable resolution - What does a durable resolution mean, and how we collaborate to achieve it.

[Use the response process](docs/incident_process.md)

### Incident Principles

Incidents are wide blast radius events and impact several different personas simultaneously. We provide principles to help members of different personas have a mental framework during incidents.

### Incident Manager Template

The incident manager template is used to make it easy to track important milestones, events, and other critical details about an incident that empower teams to communicate effectively and run invaluable retrospectives.

### Definitions

This repository aims to provide sane defaults to teams, and as a part of that, there are plain english definitions for common incident management idioms and words.

* [Severities](docs/definitions/severity.md)
* [Incident Roles](docs/definitions/roles.md)
* [Milestones](docs/definitions/milestones.md)
