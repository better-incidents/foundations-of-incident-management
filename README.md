# Foundations of Incident Management

Better Incidents is where incident management practitioners come to learn, connect, and share. Get the resources and best practices to better manage — and learn from — incidents. This repository contains all of the open source process documents and templates. Please feel free to read, contribute, and fork everything you find.


## Repository Structure

All documentation can be found in the `docs/` folder, with additional subfolders for definitions and resources like the incident managers template.

### Incident Manager Template

The incident manager template is used to make it easy to track important milestones, events, and other critical details about an incident that empower teams to communicate effectively and run invaluable retrospectives.

[Use the incident manager template](docs/resources/incident_manager_template.md)

### Definitions

This repository aims to provide sane defaults to teams, and as a part of that, there are plain english definitions for common incident management idioms and words.

* [Severities](docs/definitions/severity.md)
* [Incident Roles](docs/definitions/roles.md)
* [Milestones](docs/definitions/milestones.md)

### Incident Process

The Incident Process document is helpful to align teams on a single process as you begin to start your incident management program for engineering. It covers:

* Declaration - How we declare incidents.
* Response - How we investigate, coordinate, and communicate.
* Mitigation - What we consider mitigation, and what we do when we've mitigated.
* Durable resolution - What does a durable resolution mean, and how we collaborate to achieve it.

[Use the response process](docs/incident_process.md)

### Incident Principles

Incidents are wide blast radius events and impact several different personas simultaneously. We provide principles to help members of different personas have a mental framework during incidents.
